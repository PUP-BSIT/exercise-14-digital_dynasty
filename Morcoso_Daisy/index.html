    <h2>Thoughts about online class</h2>
    <div class="reasons">
      <p>
        Conducting online classes during periods of extreme heat in
        Metro Manila not only prioritizes the health and safety of individuals
        but also addresses logistical challenges, ensures continuity of 
        education, and promotes environmental sustainability. Embracing 
        digital learning platforms offers a practical and effective way to 
        navigate weather-related disruptions while providing students with 
        access to quality education from the safety and comfort of their 
        homes. Due to the high heat index in Metro Manila, conducting online 
        classes also addresses logistical challenges related to transportation
        and commuting during extreme weather conditions. Heavy traffic, 
        coupled with the intense heat, can make commuting to and from school 
        both uncomfortable and potentially hazardous for students, faculty, 
        and staff. By transitioning to online classes, individuals can avoid 
        prolonged exposure to the heat and minimize the risks associated with
        commuting in such conditions.
