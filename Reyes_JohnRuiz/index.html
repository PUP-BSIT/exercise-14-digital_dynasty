      <div class="oc-thoughts">
        <h2>Thoughts about online class</h2>
        <p>
          The reason why is Face-to-face classes are valued over online ones
          because they provide hands-on learning experiences and real-time
          interaction, leading to a deeper understanding of the subject matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Online classes save you from the hassle and expense of commuting in
          hot weather, providing a comfortable alternative to traveling in the
          scorching heat. However, without the structure of a traditional
          classroom, it's easy to get sidetracked and lose focus. It's crucial
          to remain disciplined and dedicated to your studies to maximize the
          benefits of this convenient learning option, especially when the cost
          of transportation and other expenses can add up quickly.
